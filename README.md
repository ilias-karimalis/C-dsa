# Data Strucures and Algorithms covered by UBC's cs221

After having completed cs221, I quickly found myself forgetting the implementation
details and complexities of the various data structures, and algorithms covered in
the course.

## TODO
1. Debug Bst
2. Implement the rest of DSA

## Data Structures:
- Singly Linked List
- Stacks
- Queues
- Doubly Linked List
- Binary Search Trees
- AVL Trees
- B-Trees
- Priority Queues
- Heaps
- Disjoint Sets
- Graphs

## Algorithms:
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Kruskal's Spanning Trees
- Prim's Spanning Trees
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path
- Fibonacci
  1. recursive
  2. dynamic programming
  3. matrix exponentiation

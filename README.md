# Fun Data Strucures and Algorithms

What is the point of learning algorithms if you can't implement them?!?
After having completed a DSA couse, I quickly found myself forgetting the
implementation details and complexities of various data structures,
and algorithms that I found interesting.

## TODO
1. Implement the rest of DSA

## Data Structures:

  1. recursive
  2. dynamic programming
  3. matrix exponentiation

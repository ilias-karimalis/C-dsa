# Data Strucures and Algorithms coverd by UBC's cs221

After having completed cs221, I quickly found myself forgetting the implementation
details and complexities of the various data structures, and algorithms covered in
the course.

## Data Structures:
    - Singly Linked List
    - Stacks
    - Queues
    - Doubly Linked List
    - Binary Search Trees
    - AVL Trees
    - B-Trees
    - Priority Queues
    - Heaps
    - Disjoint Sets
    - Graphs

## Algorithms:
    - Selection Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Kruskal's Spanning Trees
    - Prim's Spanning Trees
    - Dijkstra's Shortest Path

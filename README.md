# Fun Data Strucures and Algorithms

What is the point of learning algorithms if you can't implement them?!?
After having completed a DSA couse, I quickly found myself forgetting the
implementation details and complexities of various data structures,
and algorithms that I found interesting.

## TODO
1. Implement the rest of DSA

## Data Structures:
- Singly Linked List                    DONE
- Stacks                                DONE
- Queues                                DONE
- Doubly Linked List
- Binary Search Trees                   DONE
- AVL Trees
- B-Trees
- Priority Queues
- Heaps
- Disjoint Sets
- Graphs

## Algorithms:
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Kruskal's Spanning Trees
- Prim's Spanning Trees
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path
- RSA
- Fibonacci                             DONE
  1. recursive
  2. dynamic programming
  3. matrix exponentiation

# Data Strucures and Algorithms covered by UBC's cs221

Originally began as an attempt to implement the Data Structures and Algorithms covered
in UBC's CPSC 221 (Basic Algorithms and Data Structures), but has instead become an 
attempt at implementing the various Data Structures and Algorithms covered in Introduction
to Algorithms 3e by CLRS.
